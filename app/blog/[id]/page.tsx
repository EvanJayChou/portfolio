      title: "AI Horizons Convention",
      content: `
        <p>In August 2024, I joined forces with a few incredible individuals to start the Artificial Intelligence Club at Pasadena City College. Back then, we were fueled by big ideas and excitement about what we could build‚Äîevents we might host, initiatives we could lead, and the impact we hoped to make. Never did I imagine that those early conversations would one day lead to the AI Horizons Convention: a large-scale event that became a reality through the relentless dedication, creativity, and teamwork of my fellow board officers.</p>
        
        <p>Working alongside my incredible AI Club team to bring this vision to life was truly one of the most fulfilling experiences of my journey so far. From the late after-12-AM nights brainstorming how to make AI approachable and inclusive for all students regardless of background, to the countless meetings where every detail‚Äîbig or small‚Äîmattered, I witnessed firsthand what it means to lead with passion, persistence, and purpose. Planning this event required a lot of thoughtful planning and cross-functional team collaboration, but I am glad to have student and faculty support along this journey. 
</p>
        
        <p>What made this convention truly meaningful wasn‚Äôt just the turnout‚Äîit was the genuine curiosity, thoughtful conversations, and sense of community that filled the room. As the final event I‚Äôll ever host and organize at PCC, it was the perfect way to end this chapter‚Äîsurrounded by passionate people, meaningful work, and a team I‚Äôll always be proud of.

        <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Wrapping up an unforgettable 17-week journey as a Student Independent Research Intern at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory this Spring 2025! üì°</h2>

        <p>This internship didn‚Äôt just strengthen my technical skills‚Äîit reinforced my passion for applying AI/ML in real-world applications and innovative solutions. Interning at JPL was such an exciting, insightful, and genuinely amazing experience, one that inspired me to learn more about NASA's previous and ongoing missions.</p>

        <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my internship was the people. I had the opportunity to connect with so many talented and driven interns, forming meaningful friendships and learning from each other's work, goals, and unique perspectives. Sharing this journey with such an inspiring SIRI peer group made the experience all the more special. I also had the privilege of networking with JPL engineers and researchers, gaining insight into the NASA JPL missions and innovations that are shaping the future, and how I can further my career development and skills for a future job in space exploration and robotics.</p>

        <p>I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to my mentor, Dr. Lisa Locke, PhD, who constantly supported my learning and project development‚Äîand inspired me to continue pursuing Electrical Engineering as my academic focus and taking Communications Systems courses when I transfer to university. Your guidance and enthusiasm have been pivotal in my entire experience, and it was truly an honor to be a small part of the Deep Space Network mission and the DSN Systems Engineering Group (333F), under your mentorship.</p>

        <p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to the incredible program specialists at the JPL STEM Engagement Office‚ÄîJenny Tieu, Jen Pino, MBA, and Devyn Payne‚Äîwhose dedication and support made this internship experience truly exceptional. Their passion for student development and unwavering commitment to our success made a lasting impact on me, and I‚Äôm so thankful to have had their guidance throughout this journey.</p>

        <p>With that being said, I would like to briefly announce that this isn't the end yet: I am returning to JPL this upcoming summer as a GIS Machine Learning Engineer Intern in the VERITAS SOAR Internship Program (JVSRP)! I am so excited to continue my learning journey with NASA and JPL, and contribute to the ongoing VERITAS mission through machine learning research and geographic information systems applications in planetary sciences.</p>
